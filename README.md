This project was built following the tutorial in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts ).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

> **Note**: If you are using Node 17, this project may not start correctly due to a known issue with Webpack and Node's OpenSSL changes, which causes an error message containing `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`.  
> You can work around this by setting a `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable before starting the dev server.

## API

Project includes a fake in-memory REST API for our data (configured using the Mock Service Worker mock API tool). The API uses /fakeApi as the base URL for the endpoints, and supports the typical GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP methods for /fakeApi/posts, /fakeApi/users, and fakeApi/notifications. It's defined in src/api/server.js.

Since this is a fake API, the new post won't persist if we reload the page, but if we had a real backend server it would be available next time we reload
